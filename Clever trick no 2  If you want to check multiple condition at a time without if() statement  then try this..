Clever trick no 2
If you want to check multiple condition at a time without if() statement
then try this..
'''

a = 100
b = 75
c = 50

List = [
    a > 50,
    b > 40,
    c > 30
]
if all(List):    # all() is check that all condition must be True.
    print("Condition is True")
else:
    print("Condition is False")

if any(List):    # all() is check that any one condition must be True.
    print("Condition is True")
else:
    print("Condition is False")
